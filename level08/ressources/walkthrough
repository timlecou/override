This binary asks for a filename in argv[1].

After disassembling it I find out that the programm will open the file and write its content in backups/.<filename>
In the meantime the program will write logs in backups/.log usong a function log_wrapper().

The program will take a filename as argument and rewrite it in ./backups/<filename>

As i don't have the rights on level09's password file, I can use a symbolic link to make the program write the password:

$ ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass password
$ ./level08 password
$ cat backups/password

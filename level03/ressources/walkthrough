The binary asks for a password when I launch it and then says "Invalid password"

After decompiling and rearranging the code I have a clearer idea of what to do:

Fisrt the programme take an integer as input and stores the result of 322424845 - input in a variable that I named 'key'

If key > 21 I calls the function decrypt() with a random number as argument, else it calls it with key as argument.

The function decrypt() applies a XOR on each character of buffer_1 that initially contains 'Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3'

Then if buffer_1 is equal to 'Congratulations' it launches a shell.

To pass the key I want to the decrypt function the input must be between 322424845 and 322424824.

I try with every possibility using a script and find that 322424827 is the rigth answer.

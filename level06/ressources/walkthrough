This binary asks for a login and then for a serial number.

After decompiling it and clearing the code I understand that I have to make a condition TRUE to execute a shell.

To make this condition true, the serial number entered as input has to be equal to a number generated after many operations based on the login provided.



I made a little C code that does the exact same thing, I entered an input and printed the resulting number, all I had to do after was to use the same input and use the number as serial number.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i;

    unsigned int local_14;
    char buffer[32] = "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHH";
    local_14 = ((int)buffer[3] ^ 4919) + 6221293;
    for (i = 0; i < 31; i++)
    {
        if (buffer[i] < ' ')
            return (1);
        local_14 += ((int)buffer[i] ^ local_14) % 1337;
    }
    printf("%u\n", local_14);
    return (0);
}

$ ./a.out 
6247561
